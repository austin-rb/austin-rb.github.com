### Synopsis
There's a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt around concurrency in Ruby gets a bad rap, and we're here tonight to fix that. What kinds of primitives does the language give for dealing with concurrency?  What does a simple thread pool look like? What are some cool libraries for dealing with concurrency or for abstracting away the hard bits into patterns?

We will take a practical look at answers to these questions, touching on Threads, (a bit about) Fibers, and the Celluloid libraries for implementing the "actor" pattern for concurrency.  While this talk will assume some understanding of the basic notions of concurrency, there will be plenty of links to resources and heavily commented example code such that even a n00b should be able to find some enlightenment.

### Bio
Trevor Rosen is an Austin native and longtime Ruby developer who loves tinkering with open-source tech.  In his day job, he's lucky enough to work for [Rapid7][R7] on [Metasploit][MSF], where he manages the commercial products development team and works with some of the sharpest developers around, building industry-leading security tools and simulating cyber criminality.
