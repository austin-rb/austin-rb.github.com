[Capital Factory][CF] downtown. Our talk will be from [Scott Bellware][SB].

### Synopsis

This presentation introduces yet-another Ruby testing library that
brings design and design principles closer to the forefront. It
demonstrates techniques and principles for usage-first programming,
and reinforces TDD's primary use case as a software design technique.
It addresses the distinction between testing and TDD, and talks about
the at-times false dichotomies of types of tests. By distilling
testing and design down to the doctrine of Control and Observe, it
illuminates the grey area where testing and TDD do indeed bleed over
into each other, and addresses the power of leaving that grey area
undefined.


Even after almost a decade and a half of the Agile era, "TDD" often
remains conflated with "testing". Part of the reason is our focus - or
lack of it - on design, and part of the problem is testing frameworks
that can encourage undesirable design. Even test frameworks themselves
have become bloated and onerous, violating the design principles that
they seek to reinforce. This talk addresses the entire morass of the
TDD/testing conflation, and provides some tools and techniques to
navigate it, and to improve both testing and TDD practice, while
improving productivity, design, and quality.

### Bio

[Scott Bellware][SB] was an Agile early adopter in late-2000, and has since
taught TDD to scores of developers in coaching gigs, workshops, and
conferences around North America and Europe, including a couple of
sessions and workshops at Austin's very own Lone Star Ruby Conf. He's
been a Ruby developer since 2006, and writing code since 1981. Scott
is an avid student of the effect of software design on productivity,
and a practiced leader in the application of the Toyota Way (a.k.a.
Lean) to software development. He is the Chief Systems Officer at
Aptus Technologies in Austin.

### Kata
