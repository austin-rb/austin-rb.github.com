title: "Mentoring office hours at Cafe Bedouins"

A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of helping out at the <a
href="http://railsgirlsatx.org">Rails Girls ATX</a>
workshop.  The experience was amazing and exhausting and uplifting and 
every other positive adjective I can imagine.  For a bit of context,
<a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> is an organization whose aim
is to provide tools and a community to women to understand technology and build
their ideas (<i>stolen shamelessly from <a
href="http://railsgirls.com">railsgirls.com</a></i>).

Afterwards, I felt like we'd given the attendees a great start but that we'd 
left them a bit on their own.  There wasn't a clear direction on where to go 
next or how to keep things rolling.  <a
href="http://twitter.com/cholecoon1">A</a> <a
href="http://twitter.com/boytoms">brave</a> <a
href="http://twitter.com/lasuprema">few</a> began attending our weekly <a
href="http://cafebedouins.com">Cafe Bedouins</a> meetup and a plan began to
emerge.  Then, just today, <a
href="http://laurablogs.com/the-importance-of-mentors-for-software-developers">
ONE OF OUR OWN</a> asked for mentoring help and that was the last straw.

So, instead of using Cafe Bedouins to work on my projects or socialize, I'm 
going to open that time as office hours.  

  <ul>
    <li><i>Wanna pair on something?</i></li>
    <li><i>Need an extra pair of eyes to help debug a ruby installation problem?</i></li>
    <li><i>Got some questions about Rails or a gem or git or whatever?</i></li>
  </ul>

Come on down to <a href="http://www.houndstoothcoffee.com">Houndstooth
Coffee</a> from 8-11 every Tues night and look for the dude in the Phillies cap
and I promise I'll do my best to help.  And I don't want to speak for the rest 
of austin.rb, but I'd bet good money that I won't be the only person there 
willing to lend a helping hand.
