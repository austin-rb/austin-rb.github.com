title: "October Meeting - Top Down/Bottom up"
date: 2011-10-4

**_tl;dr_ Our next meeting will be on Monday October 17 from [7:30-9:30 at Cospace](http://plancast.com/p/7xbb). Be sure to bring your laptop!**

The theme for October's meeting, "Top Down/Bottom Up", comes courtesy of this month's speaker [Chris Continanza](http://chriscontinanza.com/). His talk will show us how to build a Heroku Add-On--and we'll get to that in just a moment--but first I'd like to talk about this theme in the context of Austin.RB.

It's time for us to re-evaluate Austin.RB from the top down and bottom up. Austin.RB was founded with the vision of learning from each other how to be a better programmer, as well as a better communicator. [Being a hacker is, after all, about two things: programming and communication.  ](http://mattt.me/2011/04/introducing-austinrb).

Getting back to those roots, I'm excited to announce a change in venue and format. For our October meeting, we'll be meeting at [Cospace](http://cospaceatx.com/). I fell in love with this venue at the last [Friday Night Hacks](http://fridaynighthacks001.eventbrite.com/); it's more intimate than the "conference talk" setup, and that's perfect for the new format.

In the first hour, we'll be flexing our coding chops as we pair up to work through a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)'>code kata</a>. I think there's immense value in the focus of katas, as well as the experience of working with someone (especially for the first time).

And--as mentioned previously--in the second hour, we'll have the distinct pleasure of welcoming back Austin's prodigal son, [Chris Continanza](http://chriscontinanza.com/) of [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/). Here's a look at what's in store:

> In this talk we'll take a look at how to build a [Heroku Add-On](http://addons.heroku.com/) from the top down and bottom up. We'll start by going over the general design and strategy of how an add-on works. We will then see how the the [kensa gem](https://github.com/heroku/kensa) allows you to test a local add-on you can develop in any language, like Ruby. Bring your laptop and you'll walk away with a working prototype in [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

> [Chris Continanza](http://chriscontinanza.com/) is a member of the Heroku Add-ons team and loves a good pull request.

If you haven't been to an Austin.RB in a while, now would be a great time to check back. This will surely be an evening to remember. I hope to see everyone there.
