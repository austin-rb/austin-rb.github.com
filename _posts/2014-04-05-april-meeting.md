title: "April Meeting - From SOLID to SLIPP
date: 2014-04-07
---

Our next meeting will be Monday, **April 7th**, from **7:00-9:00pm** at [Capital Factory][CF] downtown.

 [CF]: http://www.capitalfactory.com/about/contact/

### Synopsis
The SOLID principles are a good collection of general guidelines to help
you build software that will be easier to maintain over time. Most of these
principles can be applied as-is in Ruby, but some need to be adapted.

### Bio
Louis Salin has been a software developer for more than 10 years. He spends
the majority of his time rambling about the good ol' days and tries to find
meaning in this age of chaos by focusing on software design and structure.
His first experiences were developing desktop applications on Windows using
C++. Then it was desktop applications using .Net and C#. Then Louis
regressed temporarily into the world of classic ASP before coming to his
senses and start working on desktop-like web applications using
Silverlight. Finally, grudgingly accepting that the web was going to become
self-aware and that everything app was going to be stateless forever, Louis
escaped the fatal attraction of Microsoft Webforms to work on web
applications using Ruby and Rails. Since then, however, web apps have
become desktop applications again, except that we can only code them in one
language: javascript.

Beers and socialization practice to follow at HandleBar on 5th street.
