### Synopsis

Robots are undeniably cool. As the world becomes more digital, the
number of systems that can interact with their environment has exploded.
This talk will introduce the Artoo interface for programming robot
interfaces using Ruby. We will also explore creating autonomous
processes to teach math and engineering concepts to all ages.

### Bio

[Mike Ford][MF] is a software engineer at Trion Worlds, where he
develops tools for the operations team. He has been dabbling in Ruby for
the past year. He has been working as a professional software engineer
for 13 years, and has been a hobbyist developer/tinkerer since his dad
brought home a Morrow MD-2 in 1983.
