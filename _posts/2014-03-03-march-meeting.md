title: "March Meeting - Becoming a Better Developer through Katas"
date: 2014-03-03
---

Our next meeting will be Tuesday, **March 3rd**, from **7:00-9:00pm** at
[Capital Factory][CF] downtown.

 [CF]: http://www.capitalfactory.com/about/contact/

### Synopsis
We do katas after *most* meetings, but what about doing them on your own? [Nola Stowe](http://www.twitter.com/rubygeek) will speak on how to do katas on your own and what kinds of techniques you can use to mix it up. She will also talk about some other tools and techniques for practing code! 

After, we will try a new kind of kata as group. It is called a Randori. We will have one computer hooked up to the projector and two volunteers to kick it off. One is the Driver and the other is the Navigator. The Driver is typing while the Navigator is assisting and thinking outloud. If neither has any ideas how to proceed they can ask for help from the group. After 7 minutes, the Navigator is the driver and a new Navigator steps up. 

### Bio
Nola blogs at [blog.rubygeek.com](http://blog.rubygeek.com) and recently started two new sites [www.iheartruby.com](http://www.iheartruby.com) and [www.kataclub.com](http://www.kataclub.com).
