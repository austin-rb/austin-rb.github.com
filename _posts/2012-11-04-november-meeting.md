title: "November Meeting - Learning Lua"
date: 2012-11-04
---

**Synopsis:** As a modern developer, it's getting harder to ignore the fact that the [Lua programming language](http://www.lua.org) has been popping up everywhere.  From powering scripting engines in [Nmap](http://nmap.org/book/nse.html) and [Redis](http://redis.io/commands/eval) to providing a high-level language for multi-platform game development frameworks to being used in embedded systems beyond count, Lua is handling some very interesting use cases.

Where did this language come from?  How is it structured?  What makes it cool?  This month at Austin.rb, we will answer these questions by exploring Lua from the Rubyist's point of view, diving into this small-but-powerful tool and learning enough to get started using and enjoying the language.  We'll play with lots of working code along the way, so make sure to bring your laptop!

**Bio:** Trevor Rosen is an Austin native and longtime Ruby developer who loves tinkering with open-source tech.  In his day job, he's lucky enough to work for [Rapid7](http://www.rapid7.com) on [Metasploit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasploit_Project), where he manages the commercial products development team and works with some of the sharpest developers around, building industry-leading security tools and simulating cyber criminality.

**Location:** Thanks again to [Capital Factory](http://www.capitalfactory.com/) for providing the space for this month's meeting! You can find them in the 16th floor of the Omni Hotel, downtown at 701 Brazos St.

We’ll also be pairing off to work through a
[code kata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_%28programming%29). You’ll definitely want to remember your laptop.

Beers and socialization practice to follow at a TBD location on 6th, sponsored by [Rapid7](http://www.rapid7.com).
