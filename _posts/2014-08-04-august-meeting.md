### Synopsis

Dart, a language designed by Google and recently approved by the Ecma, is build momentum as a structured and scalable web programming language. Dart compiles to JavaScript and runs across the open modern web. Nola will give an overview of the language and show how easy it is to use for console and web applications. Jesse Riggins will explain the power of the Dart VM and how he uses it at SonarDesign. 


### Bio

Jesse Riggins & Nola Stowe - Maybe we'll think of something clever to put here, but we are best experienced over beers (or root beer) at socialization practice. :) 

Beers and socialization practice to follow at HandleBar on 5th street.
