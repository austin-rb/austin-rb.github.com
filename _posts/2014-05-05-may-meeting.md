Our next meeting will be Monday, **May 5th**, from **7:00-9:00pm** at
[Capital Factory][CF] downtown. 

 [CF]: http://www.capitalfactory.com/about/contact/
This month's meeting is going to be a bit backwards.  Instead of a talk and then a kata, we will start programming from the beginning.  Your mission is to install [RTanque](https://github.com/awilliams/RTanque) and create a tank to battle (or maybe just derp around in circles) in the AustinRB arena.

RTanque uses the Ruby 2D game programming library [Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org) to enable users to write small autonomous tanks that move around and try to destroy each other.  You can manually control one, or you can create rules for the tank to go out and try to smoke the other tanks.  That's what we're going to do.

It might be an exciting battle, it might be a pathetic battle, but either way it will be tons of fun!
