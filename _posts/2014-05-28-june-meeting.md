Our next meeting will be Monday, **June 2nd**, from **7:00-9:00pm** at
[Capital Factory][CF] downtown.

 [CF]: http://www.capitalfactory.com/about/contact/

Our talk this month will be from Andrew Harrison. Quoth Andrew:

> Coming from 12 years of Java background, I was dropped into the deep end of
> the Ruby pool when I joined the OtherInbox team 2 years ago. Since then, I've
> been kicking myself for not learning Ruby sooner. Being able to 'code at the
> speed of thought', along with a great community and rich code resources just a
> web search away, makes coding in ruby a pure joy.

> I still would consider myself a bit green, but I would like to spend this
> month's meetup sharing a few interesting code snippets, and then give everyone
> ample chance to share in their own excitement when it comes to programming in
> Ruby.
