Texan Rubyists (and welcome visitors),

Our next meeting will be next Monday, **April 1st**, from **7:00-9:00pm** at
[Capital Factory][CF] downtown. Our talk will be from [Tod
Beardsley][TB] the Engineering Manager of the
[Metasploit Project][MP] on "Offensive Ruby 1.5."

### Synopsis

We all know that Ruby is a great prototyping language. It's easy to pick
up and quick to turn out proof of concept code. This facet of the
language makes it ideal for turning out exploit code - small programs
designed to take advantage of security vulnerabilities.

This is an update of Offensive Ruby 1.0, delivered at LSRC6. This
version is broken up into four to five lightning talks (depending on
time), detailing the background, usage, and current state of development
for a handful of security-specific Ruby projects -- not just Metasploit!
It's also intended to encourage the Ruby community (that's you guys) to
jump into this niche development community and discuss what you can do
-- right now -- to advance the state of the art in Ruby-based, open
source security tools.

### Bio

[Tod Beardsley][TB] is the Engineering Manager for the Metasploit Project, the
world-renowned open source penetration testing platform. He has over
twenty years of hands-on security knowledge, reaching back to the
halcyon days of 2400 baud textfile BBSes and in-band telephony
switching. Since then, he has held IT Ops and IT Security positions in
large footprint organizations such as 3Com, Dell, and Westinghouse.
Today, he is passionate (some might say militant) about open source
software development, open source security research, and data
liberation, and can often be found on Freenode IRC as "todb."

### Kata

Afterwards, participants will play hacker -- you will be given a target
system on the local network to compromise, and you must use Ruby in some
way to do it.

Beers and socialization practice to follow at a location TBD on Dirty 6th.

### Location

Thanks again to [Capital Factory](http://www.capitalfactory.com/) for providing
the space for this month’s meeting! You can find them on the 16th floor of the
Austin Centre business tower, downtown at 701 Brazos Street.

We’ll see y’all there!
