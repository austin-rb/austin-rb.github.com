Texan Rubyists (and welcome visitors),

Our next meeting will be Monday, **June 3rd**, from **7:00-9:00pm** at
[Capital Factory][CF] downtown. Our talk will be from [Matt Patterson][MP]

### Synopsis

The video game industry frequently tests the limits of web- and
service-oriented architectures. Poor-performing launches, like SimCity
and Diablo 3, have made it clear that gamers expect fast, responsive
services if we're going to make games that are in constant communication
with centralized data networks. Having infrastructure out-of-the-gate
that's quick, scalable, and tunable is a must. This talk is a brief
delve into the non-blocking Ruby web framework, Goliath, and how we're
using it at Gearbox Software to power numerous APIs in a
service-oriented infrastructure that ties together Gearbox's game
titles, players, social outreach, and internal stakeholders.

### Bio

[Matt Paterson][MP] has been building web applications since 1998, when he started with ColdFusion and PHP. In 2006 he started
learning Ruby and playing with the then-1.0 Rails framework. Over the
past 7 years, Matt has worked with a variety of Austin startups and
established companies, spanning the gamut from hardware developers to
network security to corporate intranet apps to data mining. Today, he
operates as a full-time independent software consultant, with a focus on
troubled codebase refactoring, and on building high-performance
Ruby-based software to solve challenging infrastructure problems. He
also consults on team-building, Agile process, and UI development with
responsive, semantic CSS and HTML5. Outside of his role as a software
engineer, Matt is a published author, with two horror novels on the
shelves and a sci-fi adventure out later this year. He blogs
(infrequently) about software at [http://code.digimonkey.com](http://code.digimonkey.com), and about
writing and his novels at [http://mepatterson.net][MP].
