### Synopsis

Treetop is a language for describing languages. Combining the elegance
of Ruby with cutting-edge parsing expression grammars, it helps you
analyze syntax with revolutionary ease.

This talk will use a real world example to show you how Treetop makes
writing parsers fun and easy. Expect to see lots of code in this quick
introduction.
