Texan Rubyists (and welcome visitors),

Our next meeting will be Monday, **May 6st**, from **7:00-9:00pm** at
[Capital Factory][CF] downtown. Our talk will be from [Ethan Garofolo][EG]

### Synopsis

Neural networks (NNs) not only sound really cool, but they can also
solve some pretty interesting problems ranging from driving cars to spam
detection to facial recognition.

Solving problems with NNs is challenging, because actually implementing
a NN from scratch is difficult, and knowing how to apply it is more
difficult.  Fortunately, libraries, such as RubyFANN, exist to handle
the first problem.  The second problem comes from experience.

This talk will show a few different approaches to applying NNs to
Tic-Tac-Toe, comparing the results.  It'll also consider how NNs might
be applied to other more practical problems as well.


### Bio

[Ethan Garofolo][EG] is the owner of Big-Oh Studios, a Round Rock-based development
company that does web application and game development.  He has been a
Ruby fan for 6 years, and also enjoys working in JavaScript and C#.
Despite being disappointed in college when he learned that AI is nothing
but math, he has a sweet spot for such a dream-inspiring subdomain of
computer science.

### Kata

Afterwards, we will pair up and work on a Kata.

Beers and socialization practice to follow at a location TBD on Dirty 6th.

### Location

Thanks again to [Capital Factory](http://www.capitalfactory.com/) for providing
the space for this month’s meeting! You can find them on the 16th floor of the
Austin Centre business tower, downtown at 701 Brazos Street.

We’ll see y’all there!
