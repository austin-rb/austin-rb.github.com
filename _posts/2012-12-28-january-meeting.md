Fellow Rubyists,

Our next meeting will be on the **new and improved first Monday** of the month:
**January 7**, from **7:00-9:00pm (new time)** at [Capital Factory][CF]
downtown. Our talk will be from [Richard Schneeman][RS] of [Heroku][] on
[The 12-factor App][12f].

### Synopsis

Heroku has deployed millions of web apps. When you’ve run that many
applications, it’s hard not to notice when frameworks and developers do things
wrong, and when they do them right. We’ve taken a look at the most common
patterns and boiled down the best of our advice in to 12 simple factors that can
help you build your next app to be stable, successful, and scaleable. After this
talk you’ll walk away with in depth knowledge of web framework design patterns
and practical examples of how to improve your application code.

### Bio

Richard “[@schneems][]” writes Ruby at Heroku at teaches Rails at the University
of Texas. When he isn’t obsessively compulsively playing Starcraft 2 he writes
such gems as [Wicked][], [Sextant][], and [oPRO][]. Before working as a
programmer, Richard was a waiter at Outback Steakhouse where he learned the
difference between a bloomin’ onion and an awesome blossom.
